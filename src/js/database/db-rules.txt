Firestore Rules Section
- Users must be logged in to access trips or any facet of the database.
- Users can only access their own trips.
- All data thereafter in the trip is user-restricted.
- They may contain (and only contain) the properties as seen in the sample database.


Control Access to Specific Field Section
- Users cannot modify the UID attribute in the trips field [this is not part of rules, since firestore rules cannot filter out information.]
- The UID attribute must not be exposed in a read.
